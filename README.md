# Installation

To install `bankroll` as a Python package, simply run `pip` (or `pip3`, as it may be named on your system) from the repository root:

```
pip install .
```

This will also make the command-line tool available directly:

```
bankroll --help
```

# Connecting to brokers

After being set up, `bankroll` can be used from the command line to bring together data from multiple brokerages.

For example, to show all positions held in both Interactive Brokers and Charles Schwab:

```
bankroll \
  --ibkr-tws-port 7496 \
  --schwab-positions ~/Positions-2019-01-01.CSV \
  --schwab-transactions ~/Transactions_20190101.CSV \
  positions
```

Run with `--help` to see all options:

```
bankroll --help
```

## Interactive Brokers

[Interactive Brokers](http://interactivebrokers.com) (sometimes abbreviated as IB or IBKR) offers a well-supported [API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/), which—along with [ib_insync](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync)—makes it possible to load up-to-date portfolio data and request real-time information about particular securities.

Because this integration is so useful, **some generic functionality in `bankroll` will require an IB account.**

Unfortunately, [one of IB's trading applications](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/initial_setup.html)—Trader Workstation or IB Gateway—must be running and logged-in to accept API connections. You may wish to use [IBC](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC) to automate the startup and login of these applications.

Once Trader Workstation or IB Gateway is running, and [API connections are enabled](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/initial_setup.html#enable_api), provide the local port number to `bankroll` like so:

```
bankroll \
  --ibkr-tws-port 7496 \
  [command]
```

### Querying trade history

IB's [Trader Workstation API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/) does not support retrieving information about an account's historical trades, so `bankroll` must use their [Flex Web Service](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/am/am/reports/flex_web_service_version_3.htm).

To set this up, log in to [Account Management](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/portal), then browse to _Settings_ → _Account Settings_ in the sidebar:

<img width="312" alt="Account Settings" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676482-17f5c200-58ce-11e9-8560-a42fe755752b.png">

In the _Reporting_ section of this page, click the gear to configure _Flex Web Service_:

<img width="444" alt="Flex Web Service" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676518-b124d880-58ce-11e9-802c-842d1e17dd42.png">

**Once configured, copy the _Current Token_ for use on the command line.**

Then, you must save a query for `bankroll` to use. Back in the sidebar, browse to _Reports_ → _Flex Queries_:

<img width="309" alt="Flex Queries" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676496-4ffd0500-58ce-11e9-9a2b-d530b2d0c5c9.png">

Click the gear to configure _Custom Flex Queries_:

<img width="445" alt="Custom Flex Queries" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676519-b124d880-58ce-11e9-901d-0482d2e0e1cf.png">

Create a new Trade Confirmation Flex Query Template:

<img width="496" alt="Trade Confirmation Flex Query Templates" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676520-b124d880-58ce-11e9-9c2b-17b41e8a2fff.png">

Pick a name of your choosing, then make sure the _Date Period_ reflects the historical period you care about (e.g., _Last 365 Calendar Days_):

<img width="781" alt="Trade Confirmation Flex Query Details" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676521-b124d880-58ce-11e9-8b15-0232fd7ba795.png">

Under _Sections_, click _Trade Confirmations_ and enable everything in the dialog which appears:

<img width="175" alt="Trade Confirmation button" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676522-b124d880-58ce-11e9-997b-2129101cdd08.png">
<img width="808" alt="Trade Confirmation options" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676517-b124d880-58ce-11e9-93d0-dbee91862c04.png">

**After saving your query, expand it in the list to view and copy the _Query ID_ for use on the command line.**

With the token and the query ID from your account, historical trades can be downloaded:

```
bankroll \
  --ibkr-flex-token [token] \
  --ibkr-trades [query ID] \
  activity
```

### Querying dividend history

_This workflow [will be simplified](https://github.com/bankroll-py/bankroll/issues/36) in the future._

To incorporate the history of dividend payments in your portfolio, follow the same steps for the [Trade Confirmation Flex Query](#querying-trade-history), but create an Activity Flex Query instead.

The only section which needs to be enabled is _Change in Dividend Accruals_:

<img width="444" alt="Activity query options" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/57235238-5809ab00-701a-11e9-84c0-6abcf3f2cb93.png">

Pass your existing token, and the new query's ID, on the command line:

```
bankroll \
  --ibkr-flex-token [token] \
  --ibkr-activity [query ID] \
  activity
```

## Charles Schwab

[Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com) does not offer an API, but it does provide [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files for export, which `bankroll` can then import.

Browse to the "Positions" and/or "Transactions" screen:

<img width="559" alt="Positions and Transactions" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676591-dfef7e80-58cf-11e9-91e1-845caf625e85.png">

Click the "Export" link in the top-right:

<img width="219" alt="Export" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/432536/55676579-825b3200-58cf-11e9-8626-793d1d465e70.png">

Then provide the paths of either or both these downloaded files to `bankroll`:

```
bankroll \
  --schwab-positions ~/path/to/Positions.CSV \
  --schwab-transactions ~/path/to/Transactions.CSV \
  [command]
```

## Fidelity

[Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com) is supported through a similar facility as [Schwab](#charles-schwab).

* To export position data, [download from the Portfolio Positions page](https://www.fidelity.com/webcontent/ap002390-mlo-content/18.09/help/learn_portfolio_positions.shtml#canidownload).
* To export transactions data, [download from the History page](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/faqs-exporting-account-information#).

More detailed instructions have yet to be written—[contributions welcome](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Vanguard

[Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com) is a **work in progress**, and may not be as fully-featured as the other brokerages listed here. [Contributions welcome](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## (your broker here)

`bankroll` intends to abstract away broker-specific details as much as possible, to minimize the work required to support each one, so if your broker isn't listed above, please consider [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) an implementation for them! We want the list to grow over time, because it's extremely useful to be able to aggregate and analyze data across multiple brokers at once.

To add a new brokerage, create a new subclass of [`AccountData`](bankroll/model/account.py), then implement the methods as required by the interface. As long as the new subclass is loaded at runtime, it will be automatically included in functionality like [data aggregation](bankroll/aggregator.py).

# Saving configuration

To preserve settings across runs, all of the command-line arguments demonstrated above can also be saved into an [INI file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure). The configuration file is especially useful to store default values, because when a setting is specified in a configuration file _as well as_ on the command line, the command-line argument will take precedence.

To create a configuration, copy [`bankroll.default.ini`](bankroll/bankroll.default.ini) to `~/.bankroll.ini`, or leave it in your working directory as `bankroll.ini`, then edit the file to apply your desired settings.

If you would like to store the configuration somewhere else, you can also provide custom paths via the `--config` argument on the command line.

# Extending `bankroll`

Although the command-line interface exposes a basic set of functionality, it will never be able to capture the full set of possible use cases. For much greater flexibility, you can write Python code to use `bankroll` directly, and build on top of its APIs for your own purposes.

For some examples, [see the included notebooks](notebooks/).
